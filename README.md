Introduction
------------

This repository accompanies the paper *"Insertional mutagenesis identifies
drivers of a novel oncogenic pathway in invasive lobular breast carcinoma"*,
which describes the use of a Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis screen mice to
identify novel drivers of Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC), the second most
common subtype of human breast cancer.

Here we provide the files and code needed to reproduce the computational
analyses performed in the paper.
