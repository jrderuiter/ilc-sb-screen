Introduction
------------

This repository accompanies the paper *"Insertional mutagenesis identifies
Myh9, Ppp1r12a/b and Trp53bp2 as drivers of a novel oncogenic pathway in
invasive lobular breast carcinoma"*, which describes the use of a Sleeping
Beauty mutagenesis screen mice to identify novel drivers of Invasive Lobular
Carcinoma (ILC), the second most common subtype of human breast cancer.

Here we provide the files and code needed to reproduce the computational
analyses performed in the paper.
