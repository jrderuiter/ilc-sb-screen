This documentation and corresponding repository accompany the paper
*"Insertional mutagenesis identifies Myh9, Ppp1r12a/b and Trp53bp2 as drivers
of a novel oncogenic pathway in invasive lobular breast carcinoma"*, which
describes the use of a Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis screen mice to identify
novel drivers of Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC), the second most common
subtype of human breast cancer.
