Analysis notebooks
==================

Our analyses and results are described in several Jupyter notebooks, which can
be used to generate most of the Figures and Tables in the paper. The analyses
are divided into the following notebooks:

1. `Tumor morphology <https://github.com/jrderuiter/ilc-sb-screen/blob/master/notebooks/1.%20Morphology.ipynb>`_ (Figure 1)
2. `Expression analyses <https://github.com/jrderuiter/ilc-sb-screen/blob/master/notebooks/2.%20Expression%20analyses.ipynb>`_ (Figure 2)
3. `Insertion analyses <https://github.com/jrderuiter/ilc-sb-screen/blob/master/notebooks/3.%20Insertion%20analyses.ipynb>`_ (Figure 3)
4. `Human relevance <https://github.com/jrderuiter/ilc-sb-screen/blob/master/notebooks/4.%20Human%20relevance.ipynb>`_ (Figure 4)
5. `Truncation variants <https://github.com/jrderuiter/ilc-sb-screen/blob/master/notebooks/5.%20Truncation%20variants.ipynb>`_ (Figure 5)
6. `TIDE analysis <https://github.com/jrderuiter/ilc-sb-screen/blob/master/notebooks/7.%20Tide%20analysis.ipynb>`_ (Figure 7)

A. `Supplemental Tables <https://github.com/jrderuiter/ilc-sb-screen/blob/master/notebooks/A.%20Supplemental%20tables.ipynb>`_
B. `Supplemental Figures <https://github.com/jrderuiter/ilc-sb-screen/blob/master/notebooks/B.%20Supplemental%20figures.ipynb>`_

In general, each notebook describes the analysis for a single Figure or set
of results. The latter two notebooks contain a number of supplemental analyses
that are not included in the other notebooks.

Static versions of the notebooks can be viewed in the Github repository_.
